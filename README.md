# base

> frua.base is a personal library made by the author to follow DRY practices.

My goal is to provide a development framework based on the standard library.

My aim is to be generic and tested.

**frua.base shall not pull dependencies other than the standard library (except for packaging and documentation). It should not reimplement the standard library.**
